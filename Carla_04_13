ten datasets

graph NMI vs. number of data that user must inspect (13 per triplet)

em by itself
phase 1 alone
em then phase 2
phase 1 phase 2 

just use the highest likelihood for EM

* different methods within phase 1 or phase 2 will be different
  lines or different graphs
* can take several starting points from EM and try all of them
  and either average the results for each point in the plot
  or draw a line for each starting point

x axis: number of instances examined (13 for a triple)
y axis: NMI

Also good to implement the starting pointns from Vu2010
