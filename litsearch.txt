n [4, 5, 23]


* In each dimension, get info from user on what values are interesting
  in that dimension and 'probabilistically discretize' by creating a
  set of gaussians over that variable to fit the data.

* In any dimension, ask user to group responses, ie in MS data, should
  0,1 relapses be treated the same, then 2,3,4,5 then 6 + or something
  like that.

* Show some examples within a cluster and let the user tell us if any
  points don't belong.
