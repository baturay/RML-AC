* when starting points are saved in parts_exp,
  we actually save the whole EM, which means that
  we start the next thing with not only the initial
  centers but also the other parameters of EM

* since tripcons is not non-deterministic, we do not
  run multiple times per starting position

* limited the starting points finder to 5 iterations

* in SmartStarts we now stop asking about clusters that
  are determined to be consistent (APR 23 2012)
